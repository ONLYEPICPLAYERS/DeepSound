This generates spectrogram from images.
Sound spectrogram are a type of graph used in sound engineering to represent the "signature" of a sound. 

They are the representation of the frequencies heard by unit of time. The frequency strengh is denoted by the colour of the graph at that point.
Therefore, **it is possible to generates a soundwave such that its spectrogram would represent an images**. This is the aim of this project.
Example of normal sound spectrogram:

I did two versions: 

## The original version
This one in Python 3. It takes as input an image, an output location and its duration and outputs a
WAV file containing the soundwave which spectrogram matches the image.

It can be used as follow:

    python3 spectrogen.py image.png sound.wav

for a 5 second `sound.wav` file which spectrogram represents `image.png`.<br>
`image.png` can be of any size and can be partially transparent. <br>
There's more customisation you can do onto the outputted file, just type `python3 spectrogen.py -h` to see every options and what they do.

The `sound.wav` file is outputted in 16bit WAV file with a sample rate of 44100.
The frequencies on which the image is encoded span from 0 to 22000 Hz as that's the maximum frequency that my version of Audacity allows me to see.

The program makes use of :
 - Numpy for matrix handling
 - Sympy for resampling the image
 - PIL for importing the said image
 - argparse for allowing you to pass arguments to the program with nice flags (-h, -c, etc...)
 - wave, struct and math which are just native python3 libraries (I think)
 
 They can all be installed with:

    pip3 install numpy sympy Pillow argparse

## The funnier version
This other version is entierly re-written in Javascript, HTML and CSS and can run offline by simply loading the `index.html` file in your favourite browser (tested on Firefox Quantum).
This version makes use of the **HTML5 canvas** feature to allow you to *draw* you spectrogram on a canvas, then press "Play" to play it or "Save" to download it. The colour has no effect
on the produced music but it's pretty so I added it anyway.

The downloaded file can be rendered in Audacity as a spectrogram and on it will appear the drawing you did on the HTML5 canvas.

<s>I will very soon publish a live version of this on my website for internet people (you) to fiddle with.</s>

All this project is opensource, if you use the sources please credit me that'd be nice of you.
